# AnklePi

This is a prototype app for controlling the device featured in the Semi-Active Weightlifting Prosthetic Ankle repository. After initializing bluetooth function on the ankle, the phone can pair and connect. The app features real-time tracking of air pressure and ankle angle. Currently, only a direct air pressure command can be given, but future work includes different walking and weightlifting modes.
